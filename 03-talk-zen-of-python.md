If you're not familiar with Python, don't be alarmed if this looks confusing. By the end of the workshop this will all make sense. And you can always refer back to the Zen of Python by using "import this".

Name spacing is not a beginner concept so we won't talk about it in this workshop but feel free to find us in the break or email any questions to us.

Estimated: 10:30 - 10:50
