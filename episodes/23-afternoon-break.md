## Reflection exercise

Over break, reflect on and discuss the following:

- A common refrain in software engineering is "Don't Repeat Yourself". How do the techniques we've learned in the last
  lessons help us avoid repeating ourselves? *Note that in practice there is some nuance to this and should be balanced
  with doing the simplest thing that could possibly work.*
- How do you think the techniques we've learned in the last lessons could be applied to your own work?
