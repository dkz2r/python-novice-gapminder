## Reflection exercise

Over coffee, reflect on and discuss the following:

- What other kinds of types and variables might there be in Python?
- How can we combine things like "len" and slicing to get the last element of a list?
- How would you define a "meaningful" variable name?
- Do you agree with the Zen of Python? Why or why not?
